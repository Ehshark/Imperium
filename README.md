# Imperium - Final Project

## Random Matchmaking using Photon - (March 23, 2020):

1. Download/clone the repo. Run the executable located at Builds/Test1/Imperium.exe.

2. Enter a name and click on the "Connect to Photon" button. (Button will not work if no name is entered).

3. Once connected, the "Play" button will become interactable. Clicking on it now will create a room in the Photon Server and change the play button to say "Waiting for second player..."

4. Start a new instance of the game and repeat the above steps (enter a different username this time).

5. With the room already created, press Play on the second instance to join the room. This will start a 3-second timer and both instances should show a new scene with the player's names.
